# HP-1000CX-Serial
!(Plug Image)[images/IMG_5599.JPG]
This is a simple PCB that adapts the 10-pin, 2mm-pitch serial port on the HP 1000CX (and similar) Palmtop PCs out to a standard DB9 plug. The port on the device is electrically equivilent to a standard 9-pin serial port and so this design simply transfers the pins across to a larger footprint. I believe other devices like the HP 95LX, 100LX, and 200LX have the same socket and so it might also work with those, however I haven't been able to test that.

## Issues
* I had more than one instance where solder flowed in to the 10-pin header while soldering the pins and blocked the hole. I ended up using a vice to keep the vertical while soldering.
